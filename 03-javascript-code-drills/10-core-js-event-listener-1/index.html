<!-- # Event Listeners #

### Event listeners are one of our many tools for interacting with the user. In conjunction with getElementById, we can create dynamic pages that respond to user input ###

1. Create an html page and link your css file.

2. Create an event listener that console logs whatever key that the user presses

2. Within that event listener, create a confirm dialogue when the user presses the `h` key on their keyboard. Store their response.

3. Within your event listener, create an alert when the user presses the `k` key
    * if the user had answered yes in the previous confirm dialogue, have the the alert say "Hello"
    * if the user had answered no in the previous confirm dialogue, have the alert say "No thanks" -->
