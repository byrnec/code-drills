Playing with Images and Links



Add an image to your page that you like. It could be a picture of you stored online or an image that resonates with you somehow.


Remember to add an alt tag to the image!


Create an unordered list.
Add a link to your Github account as the first element of that list.
If you have a LinkedIn page, add a link to that as the second element of the list. If you don't just make the link point to LinkedIn's homepage.
Create a placeholder link to your portfolio page as the third element of the list.
Add a link to your favorite website as the fourth element of the list.



Bonus


Make your image a link to google.com.
Make your links open in a seperate tab.
Embed a youtube video after your links.
